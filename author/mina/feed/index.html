				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week at Camp Stella Puella, the girls chose to focus on the topic of Aboriginal issues in Canada. Such an important issue this is as the girls began to understand some unbelievable realities of people right here in Canada. Whether it be the disparity in funding for Aboriginal schooling, the effects of the Alberta Tar Sands on Aboriginal communities or the fact that as much as 20% of Canada’s Aboriginal population live without access to clean water, we gained a greater understanding of these issues through interactive games and activities.</p>
<p>Later in the week, we were graced by the presence of Kahsenniyo Williams, an Aboriginal Mohawk woman from Six Nations in Caledonia, Ontario. She was an inspiration to us all and she awed us by her wise messages and talents. Kahsenniyo spoke to the girls about traditions in her culture. She spoke about the interconnection between water, environment and how women carry these entities of water and land with them. The girls learned that many Aboriginal communities are organized as matriarchy societies. The girls were amazed by this difference in having women as the leaders and decision-makers in a family and the community.</p>
<p>Next, Kahsenniyo performed spoken word poetry for our group. This was so powerful and inspiring. She explained to the girls that each of us has a voice that needs to be heard and a special talent that needs to be shared with others. Through her conviction and talent, the girls walked away with an important message: “you do not have to look a certain way to be beautiful; you are beautiful for the way you interact with your community, your friends and your family, for the words you speak and the people you inspire”.</p>
<p>Thank you Kahsenniyo and <a title="Reztore Pride" href="http://www.reztorepride.com/">Reztore Pride </a>for making this day possible! And congratulations to our Session Two 2013 Superstars for raising $278.08 for Reztore Pride! Check out the spoken word poem written by the girls at CSP session two below:</p>
<p>Nothing is fresh<br />
We are out of breath<br />
The stress is making us a mess<br />
Our nest is no longer blessed<br />
Our nest is less<br />
Their people are being put to the test unlike the rest<br />
The water needs to be boiled because it got spoiled from under the soil it got oiled<br />
Our community may be small<br />
But not all will surrender<br />
But we stand tall<br />
We will not fall<br />
Together we can fit all<br />
But now we stand tall<br />
We are like a brick wall<br />
That will never fall<br />
We know the rest is a big test<br />
We will be strong<br />
Sing our song<br />
And carry on.</p>
