				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As our campers and counselors pack up to leave the beautiful Bliss Haven Retreat Centre, it is safe to say that our first ever CSP overnight camp was a huge success! We are incredibly sad that this week is over but the memories will last a lifetime. There were dozens of highlights this week including, kayaking on the Grand River, themed dinners, visits from special guest speakers and musicians, a skype call from 14 year old <a title="Youngest person to swim Lake Ontario" href="http://http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/annaleise-carr-14-youngest-person-to-swim-lake-ontario/article4488859/">Annaleise Carr</a>, the week end talent show, and Friday&#8217;s Take Action Day spent volunteering in the Dunnville community. We couldn&#8217;t be more proud of the 26 superstar campers who participated whole heartedly in all of this weeks activities; learning more about themselves and the world they live in. Our in-depth workshops focused on issues of child labour, water, the environment, and global health. As well each day, campers had time to focus on confidence building and personal awareness. The week concluded with the formulation of cabin group and personal action plans addressing issues such as bullying, as well as animal and human rights.</p>
<p>A huge shout out goes to our amazing overnight counselors for all their work and enthusiasm this week! Also a huge thank you to special guest Carly Carrigan who choreographed and filmed this amazing <a title="CSP LOVE" href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?v=215083988620017&amp;set=vb.122408727826845&amp;type=2&amp;theater">video</a> with us!</p>
<p>Thank you everyone for an incredible Summer 2012!! We look forward to seeing you all next summer!</p>
<p>&lt;3 Yasmin, Mina and Julia</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As our final session of day camp comes to an end we reflect on the incredible experiences our campers have shared this week. We had a great time learning about the environmental issues facing our planet as well as addressing problems of bullying. The week concluded with the girls hosting an Eco Tea Party on Thursday night. Guests enjoyed fair trade baked goods and delicious organic teas in the outdoor café. Thanks to everyone who came out to support us!</p>
<p>We are so proud of all our super star campers and their accomplishments this week.</p>
